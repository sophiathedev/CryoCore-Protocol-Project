# Project Ideas

This branch is used to collect, discuss, and develop ideas for the project. The goal is to create a space to record any creative ideas, improvements, or aspects that need to be tested before implementing them into the main branches.

---

## Purpose

- **Idea Recording**: All ideas related to the project will be stored here for reference.

- **Discussion**: This is where team members discuss the feasibility of ideas.

- **Initial Testing**: Some features can be tested in this branch.

## How to Use

1. **Add Idea**:
- Create a new Markdown file or edit an existing file to record your idea.

- The idea file should have a clear structure such as:

- Idea name
- Short description
- Benefits
- Steps to implement or test.

2. **Group Discussion**:
- Use GitHub Issues or add comments to commits in the branch to discuss the idea.

3. **Evaluate and Implement**:
- Once the idea is accepted, it can be moved to the main development branch for implementation.

## Note

- This branch should not contain completed or deployed source code.

- Any changes in this branch should be clearly marked with detailed descriptions in the commit to avoid confusion.
